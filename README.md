# DataScience_ClassifierAssignment

Attached is a py file that has code for splitting heart test data into 75% train and 25% test dataset.

Then I have explained in detail along with the screeshots of results in the document and have also created confusion matrices for all 3 modes - KNN, decision tree and Random forest. Have also explained which model I preferred the most and why.

I have also attached WEKA results for the decision tree matrix.
